# Landing Page Project

First of all the Project has 4 sections Inside of it Each Section consist of id , data-nav (The Section Number) .
The Sections are stored in a variable and a ForEach loop that loops over them that creates a list and Anchor for each one
Also there's a variable that gets the data-nav name, then all of them are appended to the fragment into the nav bar.
An Event Listener is responsible to excecute a function each time the user scrolls it checks for the bounds of the viewport for each section
and if its inside of the view it will be colored differently of the rest with the anchor Links of the selected section.
